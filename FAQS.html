          take full responsibility for returning and refunding the item in

          processed within 14 days and are automatically made using the original

          Please note, orders placed during office hours (Monday - Friday,
          8:00am - 5:00pm EST) are typically processed within 2-3 working days,
          while delivery times depend on the carrier and shipping method. Since
          deliveries are not made on Saturdays, Sundays, or public holidays,
          they will be made on the following working day. If you have any
          questions or are experiencing delays with the delivery of your order,
          please contact Customer Support.

        <p class="paragraph">
          Our order fulfillment center aims to deliver all orders within
          specified delivery times. Unfortunately, for reasons beyond our
          control, deliveries may very occasionally be subject to delays.

          Once you have placed the order, it is not possible to change the
          delivery address. In the event that the delivery should fail, your
          order will return to our warehouse and you can be reimbursed in the
          manner described here. We remind you that the refund will be finalized
          within 14 days, depending on the timing offered by your bank. If you
          have any questions or you didn't receive the refund, please contact
          our Customer service.

          within 14 days from when you receive your return authorization. Please
